This is a Contact Management Application built using Vite and React.js. The application allows users to store names and email addresses as contacts and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## Features

- Add new contacts with name and email.
- View a list of all contacts.
- Edit existing contacts.
- Delete contacts.
- Search contacts by name.

## Technologies Used

- **Vite**: A fast build tool for modern web projects.
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Firebase Firestore**: A NoSQL cloud database to store and sync data.
- **Formik**: A library for building forms in React.
- **Yup**: A JavaScript schema builder for value parsing and validation.

        storageBucket: "<YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET>",
        messagingSenderId: "<YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID>",
        appId: "<YOUR_APP_ID>"
      };

      const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
